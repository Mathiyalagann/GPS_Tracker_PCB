# GPS Tracker – PCB Design (Arduino)

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **PCB design for a GPS Tracker system** based on **Arduino**.  
The focus of this repository is **hardware design only**, including:

- Schematic design  
- PCB layout  
- 3D PCB visualization  

The PCB is designed using **KiCad** and supports a **GPS module, OLED display, battery power, and voltage regulation**.

## ⚡ Power Architecture (Hardware)
- **Battery Input → MT3608 Boost Converter → +5V**
- **+5V → Arduino Header**
- **+5V → AMS1117 → +3.3V**
- **+3.3V → GPS & OLED Connectors**

⚠️ **Usage Note**  
- USB power and battery power should not be used simultaneously.
